### Introduction
This repo hosts the ansible playbooks to deploy and configure HPE Container Platform

### Use cases ( mvp 1.0 )
  - I as a user wants to prepare the environment ( OS installation with right packages )
  - I as a user wants to have option to run pre-checks before I start installing the bits
  - I as a user wants to install/deploy HPE container platform bits with playbooks ( configure controller and gateway )

          - with HPE best practices
          - with consistent behavior
  - I as a k8s admin user wants to add and install k8s hosts
  - I as a k8s admin user wants do life cycle management (LCM) operations on my k8s cluster
  
          - create cluster
          - delete cluster
          - update cluster
          - add/remove hosts
  - I as a user wants to automate the LCM of the HPE container platform with playbooks
  - I as a k8s admin wants to create and manage tenants

### Pre-reqs
        - Linux machine with ansible 2.9.x and python3.8.2 ( tested with these versions but might work with other versions too)
        - 5 nodes with centos 7.6 or up or RHEL ( not tested on SLES)
        - epicctl tool
        - jq tool
